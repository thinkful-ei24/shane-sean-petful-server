# Summary

Petful maintains an adoption list for both cats and dogs. The list is maintained in a FIFO order, so animals that have been there the longest will appear first.

# Technology
This app uses React, Redux, and Thunk to manage the UI and state on the client side. The client is backed by an API built on Node.js and Express.
